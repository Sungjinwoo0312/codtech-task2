OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 

MOBILE APP WIREFRAMING
Create wireframes for a mobile app idea of your choice using design tools like
Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. Define the app's navigation flow, screen layouts,
and basic UI elements to convey the app's functionality and user interaction.

I recently designed a wireframe for a to-do list mobile app using Figma.
This app allows users to create and manage their daily and future task lists with ease. 
The design process involved creating a clear and intuitive navigation flow, screen layouts, and basic UI elements that enhance user interaction and functionality. 
The wireframe includes features such as task creation, editing, and scheduling, ensuring users can efficiently organize their tasks. 
By utilizing Figma's design and prototyping tools, I was able to create a seamless user experience, providing a visual representation of the app's core functionalities and user interface. 
This wireframe serves as a foundational blueprint for developing the app, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and expectations.
